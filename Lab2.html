<h1 style="text-align: center;">Java Script</h1>
<h4 style="color: rgba(25, 0, 255, 0.527);">What is Java Script?</h4>
<div class="rkt">
  <p>JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. <br> 
<h4 style="color: rgba(25, 0, 255, 0.527);">JavaScript compare to other programming languages</h4>
<p style="color: rgba(28, 5, 49, 0.801);"> 1] JavaScript compared with Java. JavaScript was only interpreted at one time but is now often run through a JIT compiler. Java is statically typed, 
    while JavaScript is dynamically typed. Java is strongly typed, while JavaScript isn't. ... Both Java and JavaScript
     support many other languages.
   <br> 2] The only language that is similar to JavaScript is JavaScript itself. Why would someone create a language that is like
   some other language without offering substantial benefits.
  <br> 3]  However there are certain aspects of JavaScript that might
  find its analogy in multiple languages feature wise and not as a whole.</p>
<H4 style="color:rgba(25, 0, 255, 0.527);">JavaScript Conditions and If statements</H4>
<JavaScript style="color: rgba(28, 5, 49, 0.801);">JavaScript we have the following conditional statements: Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true. Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false.<br>

    let a, b, c;  // Declare 3 variables<br>
    a = 5;        // Assign the value 5 to a<br>
    b = 6;        // Assign the value 6 to b<br>
    c = a + b;    // Assign the sum of a and b to c<br><br>
    When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed:<br>
    a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b;<br>
These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.</P>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Example:<br>
    if (10 > 5) {<br>
        var outcome = "if block";<br>
    }<br>
    outcome;
</h4>
<H3>Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.</H3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Example<br>
    if (hour < 18) {<br>
        greeting = "Good day";<br>
    }<br>
    
     else {<br>
        greeting = "Good evening";<br>
    }<br>
